---

## 1. What DRACARYS is (one paragraph)

A **generic DAST (dynamic application security testing) scanner** that crawls any
**authorized** HTTP target, runs **generic vulnerability detectors** confirmed by
**deterministic oracles + captured evidence** (the LLM never decides truth), and emits
findings as **SARIF / HTML / JSON / Markdown**. Its differentiator is **verified
remediation**: for a target it can rebuild (the bundled lab, or your app in CI) it
generates a fix, rebuilds the target patched, **replays the original attack, and reports
FIX VERIFIED** only when the exploit actually stops working. Tagline: **Attack. Prove.
Fix. Retest.**

**Honest scope:** a real but **early-stage lightweight DAST** — evidence-first, low false
positives, SARIF/CI-native, plus verified-fix retesting. NOT a Burp/ZAP replacement.

## 2. Status (as of last update)

- ✅ Generic scanner engine + **11 detector classes**, proven to generalize.
- ✅ `dracarys scan` CLI (auth gate, safe payloads, severity exit codes, multi-format reports).
- ✅ SARIF 2.1.0 output; GitHub Marketplace **Action** (`action.yml`, Docker) + example workflow.
- ✅ `POST /api/scan` HTTP endpoint.
- ✅ MCP server (`dracarys-mcp`) for agent clients; supports mcp SDK 1.x and 2.x.
- ✅ VS Code extension (`editors/vscode`, builds to a .vsix); landing page on GitHub Pages.
- ✅ Verified-remediation campaign loop against the bundled DRACARYS BANK lab (attack graph,
  remediation, patched rebuild, retest → FIX VERIFIED).
- ✅ Next.js command center (visual, real-time) for the lab campaign.
- ✅ Quality: **83 tests**, ~85% coverage, `ruff` clean, `mypy` clean (67 files).
  ~7,200 LOC Python + ~1,200 LOC TypeScript (command center + extension).
- ✅ **Shipped:** public repo `Aman-Thaper/dracarys`, releases v0.1.0/v0.1.1/v0.1.2/**v0.1.3**,
  moving tag `v0` → v0.1.3. **GitHub Marketplace listing is LIVE**
  (github.com/marketplace/actions/dracarys-dast-scan). Landing page live on GitHub Pages.
- ⛔ NOT done: **PyPI upload still failing** (see §10); VS Code Marketplace not published
  (needs a publisher + PAT; the .vsix is attached to each release meanwhile); scanner results
  not surfaced in the web UI; no background/async scan jobs; detector coverage is 11 classes
  (no SSRF/CSRF/auth-session yet). See §9 Roadmap.

## 3. Environment constraints (IMPORTANT, non-obvious)

This machine has **no Docker, no Postgres server, no Redis, no uv/poetry/pnpm**. The repo
ships `docker-compose.yml` + Dockerfiles as the *documented production path* but **they
cannot run here — do not `docker compose`.** Everything runs self-contained:

- **DB:** async SQLAlchemy on **SQLite** (`DRACARYS_DATABASE_URL` defaults to a local file).
  Swap to Postgres via `postgresql+asyncpg://…` for prod. Enum columns use a custom
  `EnumType` (`db/base.py`) that stores `.value` and rebuilds the enum on load.
- **Lab & patched instances:** the lab is a real FastAPI app driven **in-process** over an
  httpx ASGI transport (real HTTP, no socket). The patched retest instance is a second
  in-process app with the fix flag applied.
- **Orchestration:** campaigns run as asyncio background tasks (a Redis/ARQ worker is the
  documented scale-out path, not required).
- Backend uses the project **venv `.venv`**. Package (distribution) name is **`dracarys-dast`**;
  the **import** package is **`dracarys`**.

## 6. Architecture in brief

- **Scanner path:** `Scanner.scan()` → crawl (+OpenAPI) → passive detectors on every
  response → active detectors mutate each injection point → site detectors → dedupe/rank →
  reporters. Every finding cites a deterministic oracle + paired baseline/attack exchanges.
- **Safety path (all HTTP):** planner/detector → **typed** tool request → `PolicyEngine.guard(url)`
  (scheme, no creds-in-url, host allowlist, port allowlist, private/loopback resolution,
  budget, concurrency, timeout, kill switch) → bounded httpx → evidence (auth/cookies redacted).
- **Verified remediation (lab):** campaign state machine CREATED→…→COMPLETE; the same attack
  modules run against the vulnerable app (CONFIRMED) and the patched instance (must become
  DISPROVEN) → FIX VERIFIED. Resumable dispatcher (pause/resume/stop).
- **LLM:** pluggable planner only (`HeuristicPlanner` default offline; `LLMPlanner`/Anthropic
  optional). Validation is ALWAYS deterministic Python — the model can never assert a vuln.

## 7. Detectors & oracles (current coverage)

| Class | CWE | Oracle |
|---|---|---|
| SQL injection | CWE-89 | DB error signature (absent in baseline) · boolean TRUE≈baseline & FALSE diverges (multi-context payloads incl. `LIKE '%..%'`) · time sleep dominates a control |
| Reflected XSS | CWE-79 | unique HTML payload reflected **unencoded** in a `text/html` response |
| IDOR / BOLA | CWE-639 | 2nd identity fetches another user's object with content ≈ owner's (needs `--second-auth` + `--protected-url`) |
| Path traversal | CWE-22 | traversal payload returns system-file content (`root:x:0:`, win.ini) **absent from the baseline** |
| SSTI | CWE-1336 | injected `{{191*7}}`/`${…}`/`<%= … %>` is evaluated to `1337` **and** the literal payload is gone |
| Open redirect | CWE-601 | redirect-ish param drives a 30x `Location` to an attacker host (params inspected only) |
| CORS misconfig | CWE-942 | untrusted `Origin` reflected in `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` **with** `Allow-Credentials: true` (wildcard w/o creds is never reported) |
| Exposed files/secrets | CWE-538/200 | sensitive path returns recognizable content, or a body matches a secret regex (AWS/JWT/GH/Stripe/private keys/…) |
| Security misconfig | CWE-16 | missing CSP/HSTS/X-Content-Type-Options/X-Frame-Options/Referrer-Policy; version disclosure |
| Verbose/info disclosure | CWE-209/200 | stack traces / DB error text in normal responses |
| Exposed API schema | CWE-200 | `/openapi.json` etc. served publicly |

Testbed proof: blog app (HTML) + api app (JSON) — **recall 1.0 (13/13)**, **0 false positives**
on the hardened `safe` app. Gated by `dracarys scan-selftest` and `tests/integration/test_scanner.py`.

## 8. Key decisions & gotchas (save future-you time)

- **Enum columns:** must use `EnumType(SomeEnum)` in `db/models.py` (not raw `String`) or they
  read back as plain strings. Already applied everywhere.
- **In-memory SQLite is NOT shared** across the orchestrator's many async sessions → tests use
  **file-backed temp SQLite** (`tmp_path`). The scanner/lab tests use httpx `ASGITransport`.
- **mypy trap — variable reuse across loops:** reusing one loop var name (`gt`, `det`) across
  loops of different types breaks mypy AND once caused a real bug (attack-graph REACHES edge
  pointed at a stale node). Use distinct names per loop. Bit us twice.
- **Boolean SQLi needs context-aware payloads** (string, `LIKE '%..%'` with comment, numeric)
  and a **seed value that returns rows** (OpenAPI default/example is extracted for this).
- **Passive detectors also run on active-baseline responses** so API-only endpoints (no crawl
  link) are still scanned for secrets/errors.
- **Authorization gate** (`scanner/runner.authorize`): loopback allowed; non-loopback refused
  without `--yes-i-am-authorized` / `authorized:true` / `DRACARYS_AUTHORIZED=1`. For authorized
  external scans the scope's private-IP check is relaxed (the allowlist is the control).
- **Payloads are non-destructive** by contract (read-only SQL, benign markers, short sleeps,
  OOB host never contacted). Keep it that way when adding detectors.
- **Frontend:** if `next start` shows "Cannot find module './819.js'", the `.next` build is
  stale → `rm -rf web/.next && npm run build`. Page is a client component; static export is fine.
- **Package name** is `dracarys-dast` (PyPI) but you still `import dracarys` and run `dracarys`.
- **Playwright** was used once to visually verify the UI, then uninstalled — devDeps are lean.

## 9. Roadmap / next steps (pick up here)

**Distribution (owner's accounts required):**
1. ~~git init, push, tag, release~~ ✅ done — v0.1.2, `v0` moving tag.
2. ~~GitHub Marketplace Action~~ ✅ **LIVE**.
3. ⛔ **PyPI** — blocked, see §10. Workflow is correct and proven; only auth is missing.
4. ⛔ **VS Code Marketplace** — needs a publisher id (`aman-thaper`, must match
   `editors/vscode/package.json`) + an Azure DevOps PAT with *Marketplace → Manage* scope
   and organization *All accessible organizations*. Set `VSCE_PAT` and `publish-extension.yml`
   does the rest. Open VSX is the lower-friction alternative via `OVSX_PAT`.

**Product depth (safe, high-value next):**
5. ~~Path traversal, SSTI, CORS misconfig~~ ✅ done in 0.1.3. Still open: SSRF (needs an OOB
   callback host), CSRF token checks, auth/session weaknesses, verbose-JSON PII.
   Each = oracle + testbed case + ground truth + test.
6. Background/async scan jobs + a `Scan`/`ScanFinding` persistence model (currently `/api/scan`
   is synchronous) so large scans and history work; surface scans in the web UI.
7. Wire arbitrary (non-lab) targets into the campaign so scanner findings flow into the
   attack-graph + verified-remediation where the target is rebuildable (CI use case).
8. Broaden crawler (JS-rendered apps via optional Playwright; auth login flows; sitemaps).
9. Observability: OpenTelemetry spans around scans; Prometheus `/metrics` already exists as JSON.

**Honesty guardrail:** keep every finding backed by a deterministic oracle + evidence, keep
false positives on the `safe` control at 0, and never add destructive payloads.

## 10. PyPI publish — exact state of the blocker

`publish-pypi.yml` builds + `twine check`s on the runner successfully every time; only the
upload fails. Two auth paths, both currently dead:

- **Trusted Publishing (OIDC):** fails `invalid-publisher`. The claims GitHub sends are
  correct — `repository: Aman-Thaper/dracarys`, `workflow_ref: …/publish-pypi.yml`,
  `environment: pypi` — so the mismatch is in the pending-publisher record on PyPI. The
  fields to re-check there are **Workflow name** (must be the *filename* `publish-pypi.yml`)
  and **Environment name** (must be exactly `pypi`, or blank), and that it is on pypi.org
  and not test.pypi.org.
- **API token:** `PYPI_API_TOKEN` exists as a repo secret but holds an **empty value** —
  `gh secret set` was run through a non-interactive shell, so it read EOF instead of the
  pasted token. Fix by setting it in the web UI:
  github.com/Aman-Thaper/dracarys/settings/secrets/actions. Token scope must be
  *Entire account* (a project-scoped token cannot create a project that does not exist yet).

The publish step takes `password: ${{ secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN }}` unconditionally; the action
uses the token when non-empty and falls back to OIDC when empty. So fixing *either* path
publishes with no workflow edit. Nothing has been uploaded, so 0.1.2 is still free.

## 11. Config surface (env, all optional; safe defaults)

`DRACARYS_DATABASE_URL` · `DRACARYS_API_HOST/PORT` · `DRACARYS_LAB_HOST/PORT/PATCHED_PORT` ·
`DRACARYS_SCOPE_ALLOWLIST` · `DRACARYS_SCOPE_ALLOWED_PORTS` · `DRACARYS_MAX_REQUESTS_PER_CAMPAIGN`
· `DRACARYS_MAX_CONCURRENCY` · `DRACARYS_TOOL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` · `DRACARYS_LLM_PROVIDER`
(`heuristic`|`anthropic`) · `DRACARYS_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` · `DRACARYS_AUTHORIZED` (scan gate).
See `.env.example`.
